Test automation strategy
1. Goals
a) automate all 3 required tasks
b) automate tasks that can failure the requirements
c) automate tests with clear pass/fail result
2. Test approach
This is a broader term to define; hence, it can be broken into three parts: process, roles, and technology. This includes what tests to automate and the decision of when the test cases should be developed during the sprints.
3. Execution
False outcomes and test fails are only in the Bugs class
